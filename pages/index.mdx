The Gray Foundation Data Coordinating Center (GF-DCC) provide these documents to help researchers interact with the portal, data, metadata, and other resources.

## Mission
The [Gray Foundation](https://www.grayfoundation.org), founded by Jon and Mindy Gray in 2014, is focused on accelerating cancer research to study BRCA-associated precancer and early cancerous lesions in order to develop new prevention, early detection, and interception approaches. Proposals are solicited annually to fund BRCA-gene related research. Awardees of the Gray Foundation are encouraged to collaborate together.

## The BRCA Atlas

The BRCA Atlas is a product of the Gray Foundation mission. 

In BRCA-associated cancer, no one team can provide the entirety of the big picture. Thus, each team is a discovery team that:

- Explores a thematic region of BRCA-associated cancer, reporting back an elucidation of the landscape as a collection of new findings and datasets. 
- May initially focus on a data type/research question in which they specialize, but should eventually share data and work together without boundaries to create more collaborative 

## Data Coordinating Center
Sage Bionetworks serves as the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for the Gray Foundation consortium.
