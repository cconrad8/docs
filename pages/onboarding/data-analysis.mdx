## Introduction

Data are made available on some of the most well-known platforms or apps to set the stage for better analysis collaboration as well as more impactful data sharing. 
There can be multiple platforms/apps because they are specialized for the data type.

MSKCC can also work on development or customizations of platforms/apps for a particular data type if needed. 
However, not all data may be available for analysis on a particular platform -- this depends on prioritization and suitability of the data for chosen infrastructure. 

Below, we provide more details on how data types are targeted towards selected platforms/apps. 

## cBioPortal

The [cBioPortal](https://docs.cbioportal.org/) for Cancer Genomics was originally developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) for sharing of **genomics** data. 
We provide a custom instance for the Gray Foundation. The data which should be made available include: 

- Copy Number Variation (CNV)
- Summarized gene expression (RNA-seq)
- Mutations

## CELLxGENE 

[CELLxGENE](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene) ("cell-by-gene") is an interactive data explorer for **single-cell datasets**.

- Single-cell RNA-sequencing data

## Minerva Viewer

- CyCIF imaging data
