## What is a Data Sharing Plan (DSP)?

One important component of a data sharing plan is to outline what datasets will be shared. 
We have a form that collects information focusing on this component. 
It is not as extensive as a plan described by [NIH policies](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-013.html), but is nevertheless used for the practical purpose of better data management.
By having a record of what to expect, the DCC can better plan storage, new application features, governance, and other infrastructure around the incoming data.

## How to create or update your team DSP

Once onboarded, the team PI/data lead will receive a **special link** to access their specific versions, which will often contain information already on file. 
The DCC Data Manager will be the one sending the link when updates are needed to the data sharing plan.
