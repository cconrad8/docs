## Uploading data

### Using the UI or programmatic clients

Data can be uploaded via the **User Interface (UI)** -- see [docs here](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Uploading-and-Organizing-Data-Into-Projects,-Files,-and-Folders.2048327716.html#UploadingandOrganizingDataIntoProjects,Files,andFolders-UploadingaFileviatheSynapseUI).
However, for larger and more numerous files, we recommend doing upload **programmatically** (Command line, Python, R) -- see [docs here](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Uploading-and-Organizing-Data-Into-Projects,-Files,-and-Folders.2048327716.html#UploadingandOrganizingDataIntoProjects,Files,andFolders-UploadingaFileProgrammatically).

### Help and alternative methods

In very special circumstances, the DCC can discuss:

- Mailing a hard drive
- Globus transfers
- Help with programmatic methods

## Annotating data

Data annotation is done through Sage's Data Curator App ([GitHub](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/data_curator)).
The Gray Foundation current has its own temporary instance, through the interface will be migrating to a central app that serves all consortia supported by Sage. 
We will provide more instructions when the central app is live.
