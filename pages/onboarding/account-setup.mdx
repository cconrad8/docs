## Account Setup

1. Please review the [account types here](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Synapse-User-Account-Types.2007072795.html).
2. In most cases, you will need to be a **Certified User**, so make sure you complete that step.
3. Once you have your account, let the DCC know so a team-specific invite can be sent.
4. You must accept the invitation for a Team invite. This requires following an emailed link and accepting the invitation on a Synapse team page.
