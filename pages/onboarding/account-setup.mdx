## Account Setup

1. First, it is helpful to understand the different [account types available](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Synapse-User-Account-Types.2007072795.html).
2. For nearly everyone, you'll need to become a **Certified User**. Access your account via the icon at the bottom left, so: **Account profile > Account Settings > Certification panel**.
Click on link to start the quiz. You should pass the quiz and receive a green certified badge. This is needed for data download/upload. 

3. After the above steps, please inform the DCC so that a team-specific invitation can be sent to you.
4. To join a team, you must accept the invitation by clicking on the link provided in the email and following the instructions on the Synapse team page.

5. (For designated data uploaders with high-throughput data) You should also generate a *Personal Access Token* if you are designated to upload large amounts of data via the Synapse API (e.g. raw sequencing data). 
Do so via **Account profile > Account Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Create new token**.
