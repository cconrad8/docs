## Uploading data

### Using the UI or programmatic clients

Data can be uploaded using the User Interface (UI) of Synapse. You can find detailed instructions in the documentation [here](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Uploading-and-Organizing-Data-Into-Projects,-Files,-and-Folders.2048327716.html#UploadingandOrganizingDataIntoProjects,Files,andFolders-UploadingaFileviatheSynapseUI).

However, for larger and numerous files, we recommend utilizing programmatic methods such as the command line, Python, or R. This allows for more efficient and streamlined uploading. You can refer to the documentation [here](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Uploading-and-Organizing-Data-Into-Projects,-Files,-and-Folders.2048327716.html#UploadingandOrganizingDataIntoProjects,Files,andFolders-UploadingaFileProgrammatically) for instructions on uploading files programmatically.

### Help and alternative methods

Under unique circumstances, the DCC can explore the following options:

Sending data via physical hard drive
Utilizing Globus transfers
Providing assistance with programmatic methods

## Annotating data

Data annotation is done through Sage's Data Curator App ([GitHub](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/data_curator)). 
Data are annotated by their folders and the right templates for that folder/data type should be selected in the interface. 
The Gray Foundation currently has its own temporary instance, but we will be migrating to a central app that serves all consortia supported by Sage. 
We will provide more instructions when the central app is live.

## Releasing data

Once data has been annotated, they can be reviewed (for any governance issues), made public, and assigned a DOI by the DCC (especially to use in a publication).
Please coordinate with the DCC at this stage.
