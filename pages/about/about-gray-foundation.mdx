## Mission
The [Gray foundation](https://www.grayfoundation.org), founded by Jon and Mindy Gray in 2014, is focused on accelerating cancer research to study BRCA-associated precancer and early cancerous lesions in order to develop new prevention, early detection, and interception approaches. Proposals are solicited annually to fund BRCA-gene related research. Awardees of the Gray Foundation are encouraged to participate in "team science" and collaborate together.
