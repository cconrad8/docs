# Overview

Data governance, or the management of data access and availability, is handled by the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) at Sage Bionetworks. 
Data deposited into the Synapse platform rely on the access control features implemented by the platform. 
The settings on the dataset are negotiated by the sharing agreements for the consortium. 
Currently, data is not made public until the project teams wish to release the data (usually once the paper has been published).

For researchers who wish to understand the current policies to help them with data reuse, this section covers primarily covers [Data Access](data-access).
