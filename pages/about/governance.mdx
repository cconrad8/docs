Data governance is the management of data access and availability. 

Data deposited in the Synapse platform have access control features implemented by the platform. 
Data sharing settings are negotiated by the sharing agreements between Sage Bionetworks and research teams. 
Data is not made public until the project teams agree to release the data. 

Please read policies in our [Data Access](/help/data-access) page.
