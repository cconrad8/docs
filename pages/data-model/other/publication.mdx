# Publication

We will start collecting information on publications as an important product of the consortium. 


## Protocols

A protocol is often a more specific type of publication. We encourage protocols to be published and shared; currently, these should be uploaded to Synapse. They can be tagged as protocols; the template for these will resemble publications.
