# Core Clinical Data

Teams can have a different SOP for clinical data collection depending on the experimental design. 
For example, a cohort being studied in a longitudinal metabolomics study might have different clinical data collection than a cohort studied in a snapshot sequencing study.
The Core Clinical Data Model currently represents the **minimal** clinical data attributes used for interchange among teams and made public in the portal. 
The example templates are represented below.
