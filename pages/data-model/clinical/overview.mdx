## Describing Patients and Samples (Clinical Data)

Clinical data describes human patients and biological samples. 
In defining the clinical data portion of the data model, some of the important questions were:
- How do we represent (model) patients and samples collected by the project teams as consistently as possible across different biobanking SOPs?
- What data can be feasibly collected and standardized across each of the project teams given the goals of the consortium?
- What are clinical phenotypes that would be useful to have for more insightful analysis?
