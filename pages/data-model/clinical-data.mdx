# Clinical Data

(This documentation is in progress.)

## What's important?

In defining the clinical data portion of the data model, some of the important questions were:
- How do we represent (model) a patient studied by the project teams as consistently as possible?
- What data can be feasibly collected and standardized across each of the project teams given the goals of the consortium?

The clinical data model development has involved a Request for Comments (RFC) process. 
Continued development, if necessary, will involve additional RFCs. 

The (archived) first RFC document for the current core model has been made public here.
