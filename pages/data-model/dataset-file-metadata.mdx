# Dataset and File Metadata

(This documentation is in progress.)

For Gray Foundation, assay-specific metadata is collected for the contributed data files. 
Metadata needed for sequencing `.fastq` data from RNA-seq assay is different from metadata for image data from an IHC assay -- therefore a different metadata template is provided for each of these data types.  
Moreover, even with the same assay, the output from different levels of processing will require different metadata. 
The "raw" sequencing `.fastq` data from RNA-seq require slightly different annotations than summarized expression data. 
For more on this distinction of levels of processing, see below in [About data levels](#about-data-levels). 

### About data levels

Our data levels is highly derived from the Genomics Data Commons [data levels](https://gdc.cancer.gov/resources-tcga-users/tcga-code-tables/data-levels).
