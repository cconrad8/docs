Project Title:Devising new strategies to track and prevent breast cancer development in BRCA mutation carriers

Research Questions:
1. How do basal and luminal breast cells contribute to BRCA-
related cancers?
2. How do BRCA tumor cells evolve?
3. What are the molecular defects during tumor evolution?
4. How do we detection cancer evolution in carriers?
5. How do we intercept and eradicate tumor development?
