# Onboarding Overview

We welcome new teams with a [New Teams Intitial Onboarding](#new-teams-initial-onboarding) that covers the Gray Foundation DCC and what setup is needed. 
For new staff, who may join a team some time after the project has started, there is [Supplemental Onboarding](#supplemental-onboarding), which is shorter and more flexible.

We give a general overview of the interactions and steps part of the onboarding.

## New Teams Initial Onboarding

### New Teams Webinar

This is a 1-hour webinar hosted by the DCC that will:
- Introduce new teams to the DCC, including Sage Bionetworks and MSKCC staff
- Allow teams to quickly describe their projects to each other and the DCC
- Introduce new teams to the Synapse data platform
- Introduce new teams to the portal and other products that help share and enhance their Gray Foundation work
- Inform teams of needed working groups (i.e. the governance working group) and allows teams to think about new working groups
- Describe the [Onboarding Checklist](#new-teams-onboarding-checklist)
- Inform teams of where to find resources/help/best contacts

### New Teams Onboarding Checklist

#### Team PI
- [ ] Designate at least one data lead contact for team. Note: there may be multiple data lead(s) because there are multiple individuals responsible for different data types.
- [ ] Complete data sharing plan template.
- [ ] Review and approve their public profile on the site.
- [ ] Forward all relevant additional email contacts, noting key personnel and contact preferences, to the DCC.
- [ ] Help finalize governance working group goals and schedule
- [ ] (Optional) Join the Gray Foundation Slack workspace.


#### Designated data lead(s)
- [ ] Confirm review of documentation and forward any questions or concerns to be addressed early on. 
- [ ] Decide a preferred touchbase baseline schedule and medium (e.g. quarterly over videochat or monthly over email).
- [ ] Create certified accounts on the Synapse platform.
- [ ] Confirm that they have been added with appropriate team access permissions on the platform.
- [ ] (Optional) Get more interactive training on Synapse platform. This is recommended if data lead(s) have never used Synapse or a similar platform and are not comfortable with usage based solely upon the documentation.  
- [ ] (Optional, upon request) Get more interactive training of the clinical data and metadata intake process. This is recommended if data lead(s) are not comfortable with usage based solely upon the documentation.  
- [ ] (Optional) Join the Gray Foundation Slack workspace.

## Supplemental Onboarding

This other "as-needed" onboarding is intended for new staff who join a team and are designated data lead(s) after project start, which can frequently happen. 
As soon as the DCC is aware of the new personnel relevant to the project, we will reach out with onboarding interactions and steps adapted from the above; this can be more flexible because there may already have been some knowledge transfer.
