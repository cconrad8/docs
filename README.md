# Gray Foundation DCC Docs 
These docs are provided by the Gray Foundation Data Coordinating Center (GF-DCC) to describe the consortium portal, data, metadata, and other topics.
(This is a work in progress.)

## For Documentation Users

### Suggestions and Questions
If you have suggestions or questions as a researcher (either as a Gray Foundation-supported or an external researcher interacting with our data/portal), we prefer you [file an issue here](https://github.com/gf-dcc/docs/issues). 
Alternatively, if you do not have a GitHub account or if the issue is sensitive, contact us at gray-foundation-service@sagebase.org.

## For Documentation Contributors

Please add or update a page/section in a new branch and submit a pull request (PR).

We're using the [Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) docs theme.

### Guide to Getting Started Locally 

Docs can be edited in "local development" mode with live previews. This especially helps if the changes are large and complicated (e.g. going beyond adding a new paragraph).
However, this requires some technical setup. 
1. Install Node.js on [Windows, MacOs, or Linux](https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-install-node-js/). 
2. [Install yarn](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-install-yarn) and use yarn to install dependencies for this docs site. 
3. Run `yarn next` to preview the site at `http://localhost:3000`. As you make changes, live reload will show the updated site.
